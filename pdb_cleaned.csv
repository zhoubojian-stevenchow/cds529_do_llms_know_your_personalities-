He was encouraged to pursue the later but never gave up his love for gaming and building computers. His hard work was rewarded with a scholarship to play college football and pursue a major in computer science, artificial intelligence, and data engineering. After the raid on the Rammaza hospital in Urzikstan on October 28th, 2019 and the capture of Al-Qatala's leader Omar Sulaman by the Demon Dogs of the United States Marine Corps, Hutchinson felt a calling to serve his country and chose to enlist in the Marines. His physical strength and size as well as his athelticism made him standout in the Marines while his love for computers and technology led him to become a network and data specialist. After four years of active duty, Hutchinson became a reservist and called upon the Call of Duty Endowment to help him with his military transition. He soon found a career in cybersecurity. After the establishment of the Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command, Hutchinson quickly joined back the Marines to generate, preserve, deny, and project information on and off the battlefield.
